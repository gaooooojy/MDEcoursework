# MDEcoursework - Arithmetics
This coursework builds a language called "Arithmetics" which is a textual language.

It contains five operations between reals and integers. They are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and power operation.

Users could use keywords add, subtract, multiply, divide and power solely or together to get the result of the operations. The sentences could be such as add(1,2), subtract(4.4,2) or add(multiply(3,1.2),4.7) or even more complicated.

For "add" syntax, the two numbers in the bracket are all addends.

For "subtract" syntax, the first number in the bracket is the minuend and the second number is subtrahend.

For "multiply" syntax, the two numbers in the bracket are all multipliers.

For "divide" syntax, the first number in the bracket is the dividend and the second number is divisor.

For "power" syntax, the first number in the bracket is the basenumber and the second number is times.

There are some rules added to the simple languages. 
First, users are not able to enter negative numbers in the language, if a user enter 0 as an element, there will be a waring "All the numbers should be positive numbers" and also a quick fix that the user could choose it to change the number into 1. 
Second, all the numbers in a singal bracket could be reals or integers except the "times" in syntax "power". "Times" can only be an integer. 
Apart from that, the "dividend" in the "divide" syntax could also be a real or an integer rather than other syntax.
